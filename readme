RNNLIB is currently only tested for Linux and OSX.

Building it requires the following: 

- A modern C++ compiler (e.g. gcc 3.0 or higher)
- GNU Automake
- the NetCDF scientific data library. 
- Boost C++ Libraries (headers only)

In addition, the following python libraries are needed for the auxiliary scripts in the 'utils' directory:

- Pylab
- Scipy
- PIL

And this library is needed to use the python scripts for creating and manipulating the netcdf data files:

- python-scientific (NOT Scipy) 

To build RNNLIB enter the root directory and type

./configure 
make

This should create the binary file 'rnnlib' in the 'src' directory.
Please see the wiki on the github project page and the readme files in the subdirectories for more information.
