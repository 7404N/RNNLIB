RNNLIB is currently only tested for Linux and OSX.

Building it requires the following prerequisites: 
- A modern C++ compiler (e.g. gcc 3.0 or higher)
- GNU Automake
- the NetCDF scientific data library. 
- Boost (headers only)

In addition, the following python libraries are needed for network visualization:

- Pylab
- Scipy
- PIL

To build RNNLIB enter the root directory and type

./configure 
make

This should create the binary file 'rnn_lib' in the 'src' directory.
