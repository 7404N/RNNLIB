This directory provides example experiments that can be run with RNNLIB.
In each subdirectory type 

./build_netcdf

to build the netcdf datasets, then

rnnlib SAMPLE_NAME.config

to run the experiments. Note that some directories contain more than 1 config file, 
e.g. phoneme_recognition has experiments with raw and MFC preprocessed versions of the same data.

Note that the results will not correspond to published results, because the datasets are much too small (due to space constraints).
In addition, early stopping will not be used, because no validation files are created.

However the same scripts can be used to build realistic experiments, given more data.
